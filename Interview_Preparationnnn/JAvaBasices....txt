what is marker inteface?
 
if an interface have no methods is called marker interface. we have to check by using instanceOf 
operator that object is belongs to that interface or not.

package example;
interface Permission {
	
}
public class MarkableInterfaceExample implements Permission{
        static void show()
        {
        	System.out.println("showwwwwww");
        }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
          MarkableInterfaceExample m=new MarkableInterfaceExample();
          if(m instanceof Permission)
          {
        	 show();
          }
          else
          {
        	  System.out.println("not permission......");
          }
	}

}


What is Serialization?

Serialization means converting the object state into bytestream is called serialization. deserialization means converting byte stream into object stream is called deserialization.
